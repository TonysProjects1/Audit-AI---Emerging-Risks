## Past Day

Here's a news brief on recent events affecting the Insurance & Financial Services sector, relevant for your Internal Audit Planning Committee and Risk Committee.

### Regulatory Shift at SEC and Reduced Enforcement
**Context**: A report released on November 19-20, 2025, by Cornerstone Research and the NYU Pollack Center for Law & Business indicates a 30% drop in SEC enforcement actions against public companies and subsidiaries in fiscal year 2025 compared to the previous year. This decline coincides with a change in SEC administration, with 93% of FY 2025 actions occurring before the new Chair, Paul Atkins, took office in April 2025. The report suggests a shift in regulatory philosophy, particularly concerning digital assets, as the SEC's FY2026 examination priorities notably omit crypto.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review internal compliance frameworks and policies to ensure alignment with evolving SEC priorities, especially regarding digital assets and disclosure requirements.
*   Assess the adequacy of current monitoring for potential enforcement risks, considering a potentially less aggressive but shifting regulatory landscape.

### FINRA Enforcement Actions Highlight Sales Practice and Supervisory Failures
**Context**: FINRA has recently announced several enforcement actions. On November 19, 2025, FINRA fined and suspended former LPL Financial broker Barry L. Buchholz for unauthorized mutual fund trades totaling $590,000 in four customer accounts. Separately, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay FINRA $2.5 million to settle claims that it violated research report disclosure requirements for 18 years, impacting approximately 110,000 debt and equity research reports due to an insufficient supervisory system. Additionally, former Pruco Securities advisor Mark Carter was suspended and fined for recommending unsuitable options trades and exercising discretionary authority without prior written authorization, resulting in over $600,000 in customer losses. Oakwood Capital Securities was also fined $20,000 for failing to maintain a supervisory system for deferred variable annuity exchanges.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Strengthen audit procedures for sales practice oversight, particularly for discretionary accounts and complex products like options and annuities.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of supervisory systems and controls related to research report disclosures and conflicts of interest.
*   Conduct targeted reviews of broker conduct and adherence to firm policies regarding unauthorized trading and suitability.

### Cyber Breach at California Casualty Indemnity Exchange and Escalating Supply Chain Risk
**Context**: Notification letters began on November 19, 2025, for a data breach at California Casualty Indemnity Exchange, where an unauthorized individual accessed their IT network between September 2 and September 8, 2025. This breach compromised sensitive personal information, including names, Social Security numbers, and financial account numbers. This incident occurs amidst a broader trend: a BlueVoyant report published on November 20, 2025, reveals that 97% of organizations have been negatively impacted by a supply chain breach, a significant increase from 81% in 2024, highlighting the pervasive and growing nature of third-party cyber risks.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the company's incident response plan and data breach notification procedures in light of recent incidents in the insurance sector.
*   Conduct a comprehensive review of third-party administrator (TPA) and other vendor cybersecurity controls, focusing on supply chain vulnerabilities and data protection.
*   Evaluate the adequacy of controls protecting sensitive policyholder data, especially Social Security and financial account numbers.

### State Insurance Departments Scrutinize Medicare Advantage and MedSupp Practices
**Context**: On November 19, 2025, state insurance departments in Delaware, Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Oklahoma issued statements scrutinizing unfair trade practices related to Medicare Advantage (MA) and MedSupp enrollment and marketing. Idaho's Director of the Department of Insurance specifically issued cease and desist letters to two carriers for violating stated policies. These actions highlight ongoing regulatory focus on policyholder protection and ethical sales practices within the health insurance sector.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review sales and marketing practices for Medicare Advantage and MedSupp products to ensure full compliance with state-specific regulations and consumer protection laws.
*   Assess training and oversight for agents and brokers involved in MA and MedSupp sales to prevent unfair or deceptive practices.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls designed to monitor and respond to state insurance department inquiries and enforcement actions.

### Operational Disruption: UCare's Exit from the Minnesota Market
**Context**: On November 19, 2025, it was reported that UCare, a significant Medicaid and Medicare insurer in Minnesota, is ceasing operations at the start of next year. This forces approximately 80,000 Minnesotans to find new state-funded health care coverage and an additional 158,000 Medicare Advantage members to select new plans for 2026. This event underscores the financial headwinds, such as rising costs and lower government reimbursement rates, impacting nonprofit insurers and highlights potential solvency and policyholder protection challenges within the insurance industry.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the company's financial resilience and stress testing capabilities against adverse market conditions and unexpected operational challenges in the insurance sector.
*   Review contingency plans for significant market exits by competitors and their potential impact on policyholder acquisition and retention.
*   Evaluate the adequacy of reserves and capital management strategies to withstand potential financial shocks or changes in reimbursement models.

## Past Week

Here is a news brief on recent events affecting the Insurance & Financial Services sector, for the Internal Audit Planning Committee & Risk Committee.

### Major Ransomware Attack on State Attorney General Office
**Context**: On November 19, 2025, the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General officially confirmed a significant data breach resulting from a ransomware attack by the Inc Ransom group, which occurred in August 2025. The breach exposed sensitive data, including names, Social Security numbers, and medical details of an undisclosed number of individuals. The initial attack vector is believed to be the exploitation of the "CitrixBleed2" vulnerability (CVE-2025-5777) on the agency's public-facing Citrix NetScaler appliances.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review third-party vendor management, especially for those handling sensitive data or utilizing common software vulnerabilities (e.g., Citrix).
*   Assess incident response plans and data breach notification procedures for adequacy and timeliness, particularly for highly sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

### Third-Party Data Theft via Oracle E-Business Suite Vulnerabilities
**Context**: On November 13, 2025, GlobalLogic, a digital engineering services company, confirmed that the Clop ransomware group stole personal and financial data belonging to over ten thousand current and former employees. The breach was attributed to the exploitation of critical vulnerabilities within Oracle's E Business Suite platform.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the security posture and contractual obligations of third-party administrators (TPAs) and other critical vendors, especially those leveraging widely deployed enterprise software like Oracle E-Business Suite.
*   Test controls over employee data protection, particularly for current and former employees, and the handling of financial information.

### Market Volatility and Interest Rate Risk from Shifting Fed Policy Expectations
**Context**: For the week of November 9-16, 2025, Treasury yields across all maturities unexpectedly rose by 5 basis points, despite the Federal Reserve having implemented a rate cut in October. This movement was largely driven by a broad repricing of term premium, the permanent data gap from the recent government shutdown impacting October's economic reports, and persistent fiscal uncertainty. Consequently, the market-implied probability of a December 2025 Fed rate cut significantly declined from 95% to approximately 40-50%.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the adequacy of interest rate risk modeling and stress testing scenarios, including those related to unexpected yield curve movements and changes in Federal Reserve policy expectations.
*   Review asset-liability management (ALM) strategies and investment portfolio sensitivity to rising rates and term premium repricing.

### FINRA Enforcement on Crypto Asset Disclosures and Sales Practice Violations
**Context**: FINRA's November 2025 disciplinary actions, published on November 13, 2025, included a firm being censured and fined $50,000 for distributing retail communications concerning crypto assets. These communications failed to clearly disclose that the crypto assets were not offered through a registered broker-dealer and did not provide a fair and balanced presentation of the benefits and risks. Additionally, other actions highlighted individuals failing to obtain prior written consent for outside brokerage accounts and making false attestations.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate compliance with regulatory guidance on crypto asset disclosures and marketing materials, ensuring clear and balanced communication of risks and benefits to policyholders and wealth management clients.
*   Review controls over employee outside business activities and brokerage accounts to prevent undisclosed conflicts of interest and sales practice violations.

## Past Month

Here's a strategic analysis of broad trends and systemic shifts relevant to the Life Insurance & Wealth Management sector over the past month (October 20, 2025, to November 20, 2025), for the Internal Audit Planning Committee & Risk Committee.

### Complex and Fragmented Data Privacy Landscape
**Context**: The U.S. data privacy landscape continues to rapidly evolve, with Maryland's Online Data Privacy Act (MODPA) becoming effective on October 1, 2025, establishing one of the nation's strictest frameworks, including prohibitions on sensitive data sales regardless of consent. This adds to the complexity as eight new state comprehensive privacy laws took effect throughout 2025, bringing the total to 18 states with comprehensive legislation. Aggressive enforcement actions are intensifying, exemplified by the Texas Attorney General's warning letters to over 100 data brokers, and California, Colorado, and Connecticut's joint enforcement action on Global Privacy Control (GPC) requirements.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review the company's data inventory and mapping to ensure compliance with the varying and stringent requirements of new state privacy laws, particularly regarding sensitive data handling and consumer consent mechanisms.
*   Assess the effectiveness of controls related to universal opt-out mechanisms (like GPC) and the company's ability to respond to escalating consumer data rights requests across multiple jurisdictions.

### AI Governance and Bias in Underwriting
**Context**: Regulatory scrutiny on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in insurance underwriting is intensifying globally and domestically. The EU AI Act designates AI systems used in life and health insurance underwriting as "high-risk," imposing rigorous requirements for bias testing, technical documentation, and post-deployment monitoring. Domestically, the NAIC membership is actively debating the need for a comprehensive AI model law beyond its existing bulletin, which already mandates insurers to develop written AI programs (AIS Programs) with robust governance and risk management. Furthermore, New York's Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) has indicated it may audit and examine insurers' use of AI systems for unfair discrimination. Concerns are also emerging regarding "invisible AI" denying financial services without transparent explanations.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Conduct a targeted audit of AI models used in underwriting and pricing to assess for potential biases, adherence to fairness principles, and compliance with emerging regulatory guidance (e.g., NAIC Model Bulletin, EU AI Act principles).
*   Evaluate the company's AI governance framework, including model validation, explainability, data lineage, and human oversight processes, ensuring they are robust enough to withstand increasing regulatory scrutiny and demonstrate accountability.

### Persistent Elevated Mortality Trends
**Context**: A recent industry analysis by ALIRT Insurance Research, released on October 27, 2025, indicates that death benefits paid by U.S. life insurers remain approximately 14% above pre-pandemic (2019) levels. The report highlighted a 6.4% increase in death benefits in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024, suggesting that mortality levels may have reached a new, higher baseline post-pandemic. While the report noted the industry's overall financial stability and strong capitalization, this sustained elevation in mortality continues to dampen profitability, particularly for individual life insurance.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review the actuarial assumptions and reserving methodologies for life insurance products to ensure they adequately reflect the new baseline of elevated mortality trends and potential future fluctuations.
*   Assess the effectiveness of the company's reinsurance strategies and capital adequacy stress testing in mitigating the financial impact of sustained higher mortality rates on solvency and profitability.

### Evolving Cybersecurity Threats, Including AI-Orchestrated Attacks
**Context**: October 2025 witnessed a turbulent period for cybersecurity, marked by significant cyberattacks, ransomware incidents, and data breaches across various industries, including financial institutions. A particularly concerning development in mid-November 2025 was the disruption of what is believed to be the "first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign," which targeted financial institutions, among other sectors. This event underscores a systemic shift in the sophistication of cyber threats, where AI is no longer just a tool for defense but is being actively leveraged by malicious actors to execute large-scale attacks with minimal human intervention. Nation-state actors, such as North Korea, continue to pose a severe threat, alongside financially motivated cybercrime.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the company's cybersecurity defenses and incident response plans, specifically assessing their capability to detect, prevent, and respond to advanced, AI-orchestrated cyberattacks and sophisticated ransomware campaigns.
*   Review third-party vendor risk management programs to ensure that cybersecurity controls and contractual obligations adequately address the heightened threat landscape, especially concerning data shared with external partners.

### Interest Rate Volatility and Inflationary Pressures
**Context**: The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.75%-4.00% at its October 2025 meeting, following a similar cut in September. However, expectations for a further rate cut in December 2025 have significantly diminished, with probabilities dropping from 97% in mid-October to 22-41% by November 20, 2025, primarily due to stronger-than-expected U.S. job growth in September. This indicates continued interest rate volatility and uncertainty in monetary policy. Concurrently, inflation remains a top concern for senior investment professionals, particularly the potential for renewed tariffs to drive higher inflation, as highlighted in a BlackRock report in October 2025.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the company's asset-liability management (ALM) strategies and interest rate risk modeling to ensure they can effectively navigate and mitigate the impact of continued interest rate volatility on investment income, annuity product pricing, and capital requirements.
*   Review the impact of persistent inflation on the company's operating expenses, claims costs, and the purchasing power of policyholder benefits, and evaluate the adequacy of strategies to manage these financial pressures.

## Past Quarter

Here are the key trends and systemic shifts observed over the past quarter (August 20, 2025, to November 20, 2025), relevant to a Large Mutual Life Insurance and Wealth Management Company:

### Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Data Privacy & Genetic Information
**Context**: The regulatory environment for data privacy and the use of genetic information in underwriting is rapidly evolving. As of October 2025, the U.S. has seen 17 state "comprehensive" privacy laws enacted, with more states like Indiana, Kentucky, and Rhode Island set to implement theirs in January 2026. Furthermore, Senator Bill Cassidy introduced the Health Information Privacy Reform Act (HIPRA) on November 4, 2025, aiming to extend HIPAA-like protections to health data collected by non-HIPAA-regulated entities, such as health and fitness applications. Internationally, Australia released draft legislation on September 24, 2025, to ban the use of adverse genetic test results in life insurance underwriting, a move supported by the Council of Australian Life Insurers to encourage genetic testing for health management. This trend indicates a global push towards greater consumer protection regarding sensitive personal and health data.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review data governance frameworks and privacy policies to ensure compliance with the growing patchwork of state, federal, and potentially international privacy laws, including specific requirements for sensitive health information and genetic data.
*   Assess underwriting processes and data sources for adherence to new or anticipated restrictions on the use of genetic test results, ensuring fairness and non-discrimination in policy issuance and pricing.

### AI Governance, Bias, and Ethical Use
**Context**: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in insurance underwriting is accelerating, promising reduced decision times and improved accuracy. However, this rapid integration is accompanied by significant regulatory scrutiny regarding potential algorithmic bias and unfair discrimination. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers, adopted in December 2023, has been adopted by approximately half of the states as of July 2025, setting expectations for governance and risk management. The NAIC's Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Working Group met in October 2025 to discuss further regulatory steps, including a proposed AI Systems Evaluation Tool for regulators. Regulators like the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) are also specifically targeting AI systems to prevent bias and ensure transparency in underwriting and pricing.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the company's AI governance framework, including policies and procedures for the development, deployment, and monitoring of AI models used in underwriting and other critical functions, to ensure compliance with NAIC guidelines and state-specific regulations.
*   Conduct independent testing and validation of AI models for bias detection and mitigation, focusing on fairness, transparency, and explainability of AI-driven decisions to prevent unfair discrimination.

### Macroeconomic Volatility: Interest Rates & Inflation
**Context**: The past quarter has shown continued macroeconomic volatility, particularly concerning inflation and interest rates. In the U.S., inflation rates reached 2.9% in August 2025, the highest since January, with core inflation at 3.1%. Despite this, the Federal Reserve is anticipated to resume interest rate cuts in September 2025, influenced by signs of a softening labor market. In contrast, the UK saw inflation fall to 3.6% in October 2025, leading to speculation of a December interest rate cut by the Bank of England, which had held rates at 4% in November. This mixed and dynamic interest rate environment, coupled with persistent inflation concerns, directly impacts investment income, the attractiveness and pricing of annuity products, and overall capital requirements for life insurers.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the adequacy of asset-liability management (ALM) strategies and interest rate risk stress testing, particularly given the potential for divergent interest rate paths and their impact on investment portfolios and long-duration liabilities.
*   Review product pricing strategies for annuities and other interest-sensitive products to ensure they remain competitive and profitable amidst fluctuating interest rates and inflation, while also meeting policyholder expectations.

### Climate Change Impact on Underwriting & Solvency
**Context**: Climate change is increasingly recognized as a significant and growing risk for the insurance industry, extending beyond property and casualty to directly impact health and life insurance. Reports from September 2025 highlight how climate change alters disease patterns, increases claim frequency, and drives up healthcare costs, challenging traditional actuarial models. Regulators are urging insurers to incorporate climate scenario analysis into their financial risk assessments. The 2025 California wildfires are cited as potentially the largest insured wildfire losses in history, underscoring the direct impact of extreme weather events on underwriting and investment portfolios. This trend necessitates a re-evaluation of long-term actuarial assumptions and solvency frameworks.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the integration of climate-related risks into actuarial models for mortality, morbidity, and longevity, assessing the adequacy of reserves and capital in light of changing environmental factors.
*   Review investment portfolio exposures to climate-sensitive assets and assess the effectiveness of climate-related stress testing on the company's solvency and financial stability.

### Legacy System Modernization & Digital Transformation Debt
**Context**: Despite the urgent need for digital transformation, the U.S. insurance sector is experiencing a slowdown in modernization efforts. A report from October 2025 indicates that many insurers are struggling with outdated legacy systems, budget constraints, and internal resistance, with nearly half operating core platforms that are 6-10 years old, and some exceeding 15 years. Over half of IT budgets are consumed by maintaining these existing systems, diverting resources from strategic innovation and leading to delays or cancellations of new technology projects. This "legacy system debt" hinders the adoption of advanced technologies like AI, impacts operational efficiency, and creates barriers to meeting evolving customer expectations and regulatory demands.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the company's digital transformation roadmap and the effectiveness of governance over modernization initiatives, including resource allocation, project management, and risk mitigation strategies for legacy system replacement or integration.
*   Evaluate the impact of legacy systems on the company's ability to innovate, comply with new regulations, and maintain a competitive edge, including the assessment of technical debt and its implications for future operational resilience and cybersecurity.

## Past Year

Here are the key trends and systemic shifts observed over the past year (November 20, 2024, to November 20, 2025) relevant to a large mutual life insurance and wealth management company, along with their implications for audit:

### Evolving AI Regulation and Algorithmic Bias
**Context**: The past year has seen significant movement in regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems within the insurance industry. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) adopted its Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers in December 2023, which has since been adopted by 24 states as of May 2025, with other states issuing similar guidance. This bulletin emphasizes the need for comprehensive AI governance frameworks, robust risk management, internal controls, and consumer transparency to prevent unfair trade practices and discrimination. Globally, the EU AI Act designates AI systems in life and health insurance underwriting as high-risk, imposing rigorous requirements for bias testing, technical documentation, and post-deployment monitoring. Concerns persist regarding AI bias in underwriting, where algorithms trained on biased data can lead to unfair risk assessments, prompting increased regulatory scrutiny on explainability and data usage.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review the company's AI governance framework, policies, and procedures to ensure alignment with the NAIC Model Bulletin and other relevant state regulations, focusing on fairness, transparency, and accountability.
*   Test AI models used in underwriting and pricing for potential biases and discriminatory outcomes, including the data sources, model development, validation, and ongoing monitoring processes.
*   Assess the adequacy of documentation for AI systems, including technical specifications, risk management protocols, and internal controls, to demonstrate compliance to regulators.

### Climate Change Impact on Underwriting and Financial Stability
**Context**: Climate change continues to manifest through more frequent and severe weather events, significantly impacting the insurance industry. Global insured losses from natural disasters reached US$140 billion in 2024, marking the third most expensive year on record, with early 2025 estimates for wildfires in Los Angeles alone ranging from $30 billion to $40 billion. This trend is driving health insurers to increasingly focus on climate change as a critical challenge, with regulators urging the assessment of financial risks through climate scenario analysis. Consequently, insurers are raising premiums and implementing stricter underwriting practices, leading to the emergence of "insurance deserts" in high-risk areas where coverage becomes scarce or unaffordable.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the company's climate-related risk assessment methodologies, including how physical and transition risks are integrated into underwriting, pricing, and investment strategies for life and annuity products.
*   Assess the adequacy of capital modeling and stress testing to account for potential financial impacts from severe climate events and long-term climate trends, including their effect on policyholder behavior and asset valuations.
*   Review the company's disclosures and reporting on climate-related financial risks and opportunities, ensuring compliance with emerging regulatory expectations and stakeholder demands for transparency.

### Legacy System Modernization and Digital Transformation Challenges
**Context**: Despite the clear imperative for digital transformation, a significant portion of the insurance industry, with 74% of companies, still relies on outdated legacy technology for critical operations like pricing, rating, and underwriting, as highlighted in a November 2024 report. These legacy systems are expensive to maintain, inherently complex, and create substantial barriers to innovation, scalability, and enhancing customer satisfaction. The reliance on archaic programming languages like COBOL and the impending retirement of skilled programmers are creating a critical knowledge gap, further hindering modernization efforts and the effective integration of advanced technologies like AI. This lag impacts the ability to leverage real-time data, refine underwriting strategies, and meet evolving market demands.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the company's digital transformation roadmap and the progress of legacy system modernization initiatives, including the effectiveness of governance, resource allocation, and risk management for these complex projects.
*   Evaluate the impact of legacy systems on data integrity, accessibility, and the ability to support advanced analytics and AI-driven decision-making, particularly in underwriting and claims.
*   Review the company's strategy for addressing the "knowledge gap" associated with legacy systems, including talent retention, training, and succession planning for critical technical roles.

### DOL Fiduciary Rule and Expanded Investment Advice Scope
**Context**: The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) finalized amendments to its investment advice fiduciary rule on April 23, 2024, which aimed to significantly expand the definition of an "investment advice fiduciary" under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. This rule would have broadened fiduciary obligations to include many types of investment advisory relationships previously exempted, directly impacting insurance agents and companies involved in retirement planning and annuity sales. However, a nationwide injunction issued by a Texas judge on July 26, 2024, has stopped the rule's implementation until further notice, creating ongoing uncertainty regarding its future enforcement and the scope of fiduciary responsibilities. The full compliance with amended prohibited transaction exemptions (PTEs 2020-02 and 84-24) was initially delayed until September 2025, but this is also on hold due to the injunction.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Monitor the legal challenges and potential future developments of the DOL Fiduciary Rule, assessing the company's preparedness to adapt its sales practices, compensation structures, and disclosure requirements if the rule is eventually implemented.
*   Review existing processes for identifying and managing conflicts of interest in investment advice, particularly for annuity and wealth management products, to ensure alignment with impartial conduct standards.
*   Evaluate training programs and supervisory controls for financial professionals to ensure they understand and adhere to current and anticipated fiduciary standards, even in the face of regulatory uncertainty.

### Proliferation of State Data Privacy Laws
**Context**: The landscape of consumer data privacy is becoming increasingly complex with a wave of new state-level privacy laws coming into effect in 2025. These include the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act, Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act, Nebraska Data Privacy Act, New Hampshire Privacy Act, New Jersey Data Privacy Act, Tennessee Information Protection Act, Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act, and Maryland Online Data Privacy Act. These laws generally grant consumers rights such as access, correction, deletion, and the ability to opt out of targeted advertising or the sale of personal data, often with specific provisions for "Consumer Health Data". Beyond the U.S., New Zealand enacted its Privacy Amendment Act 2025, effective May 1, 2026, requiring notice for indirect data collection, and Australia introduced the Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2024, enhancing enforcement powers for its Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the company's compliance framework for the growing number of state and international data privacy laws, ensuring that data collection, processing, storage, and sharing practices meet the diverse requirements.
*   Review the effectiveness of controls related to consumer rights (e.g., right to know, correct, delete, opt-out) and the handling of sensitive data, particularly "Consumer Health Data," across all business lines.
*   Evaluate third-party vendor management programs to ensure that partners handling personal data are also compliant with applicable privacy regulations and contractual obligations.
