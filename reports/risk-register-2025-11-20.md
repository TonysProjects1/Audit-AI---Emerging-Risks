### Philippines Flood Control Corruption Scandal Leads to Resignations
**Context**: A significant corruption scandal has rocked the Philippines, leading to the resignation of ministers and widespread public protests. Billions of dollars allocated for vital anti-flooding infrastructure were allegedly misused or siphoned off by private contractors, resulting in substandard or non-existent projects. This scandal has caused a confidence shock, impacting public spending, household demand, and contributing to a slowdown in economic growth, with third-quarter GDP growth sinking to its slowest in over four years.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Conduct a comprehensive review of public procurement processes, particularly for large-scale infrastructure projects, focusing on contract management, vendor selection, and project oversight to prevent fraud and mismanagement.
*   Assess the effectiveness of internal controls related to financial disbursements and project monitoring, especially in areas prone to corruption risks.

### International Sanctions on Russian Cybercrime Infrastructure
**Context**: The Australian Government, in coordination with allies in the United Kingdom and the United States, has jointly sanctioned two Russian individuals, Aleksandr Alexandrovich Volosovik and Kirill Andreevich Zatolokin, and two companies, Media Land LLC and ML.Cloud LLC. These entities are accused of providing services to cybercriminal networks responsible for significant cyberattacks, including ransomware campaigns by groups like Lockbit, Blacksuit, and Clop, against Australian and international businesses over a ten-year period.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review third-party vendor management processes to ensure that business partners and their sub-contractors are not linked to sanctioned entities or involved in illicit activities.
*   Assess the organization's cybersecurity intelligence capabilities to track and respond to threats originating from sanctioned cybercrime infrastructure.

### US Announces Tariff Reductions with Switzerland and Liechtenstein
**Context**: President Trump has announced a new trade framework agreement with Switzerland and Liechtenstein. This agreement includes plans for the U.S. to lower tariffs on originating goods from these countries, specifically reducing the rate on certain imports from 39 percent to 15 percent. Switzerland and Liechtenstein, in turn, intend to remove a range of tariffs across agriculture and industrial sectors. The three countries aim to finalize negotiations in early 2026.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the impact of these tariff changes on the organization's supply chain, import/export costs, and pricing strategies if operating in or sourcing from these regions.
*   Assess potential opportunities or risks related to market access, competitive landscape, and compliance with new trade regulations.

*   **Risk Impact**: Changes in trade policies can affect profitability, supply chain costs, and market competitiveness. Non-compliance with sanctions can lead to severe legal penalties, reputational damage, and restrictions on international operations.

### High-Profile Corruption Scandals
**Context**: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is facing a significant corruption scandal, with his former business partner accused of orchestrating a $100 million bribery scheme involving a state-owned energy company, as reported on November 13, 2025. This has led to renewed demands from the EU for Ukraine to intensify its anti-corruption efforts. In the Philippines, a corruption scandal involving billions in misused funds for anti-flooding infrastructure led to ministerial resignations, with criminal charges filed on November 13, 2025, against a former House Appropriations Committee member. Separately, in Madagascar, the former chairwoman of Madagascar Airlines and five co-defendants were arrested in November 2025 on charges including embezzlement related to a public procurement contract.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Audit Action**: Conduct a comprehensive review of anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) policies and procedures, focusing on third-party due diligence, public procurement processes, and whistleblower mechanisms. Assess the effectiveness of internal controls designed to prevent and detect fraud and embezzlement, especially in high-risk areas like government contracts or international operations.
*   **Risk Impact**: Exposure to legal and regulatory enforcement actions, significant financial losses, reputational damage, and potential withdrawal of international investment or partnerships.

### US Government Shutdown and Operational Disruptions
**Context**: As of November 13, 2025, the United States is experiencing one of its most significant air travel disruptions in years, with over 8,000 flights canceled since November 7. This widespread operational disruption is attributed to an ongoing federal government shutdown, which has resulted in thousands of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic controllers working without pay, leading to staffing shortages and reduced air traffic levels across 40 of the country's busiest airports.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Audit Action**: Evaluate business continuity and disaster recovery plans, specifically assessing their effectiveness in addressing prolonged government shutdowns or widespread infrastructure disruptions. Review the impact on employee morale, productivity, and retention in critical operational areas that may be affected by government funding issues.

## Past Month

Here's a strategic analysis of broad trends and systemic shifts from October 20, 2025, to November 20, 2025, for the Internal Audit Planning Committee.

### Escalating Cyber Threats: Ransomware, AI-Enhanced Attacks, and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
**Context**: October 2025 witnessed a significant surge in cyberattacks globally, with organizations experiencing an average of 1,938 attacks per week, marking a 2% increase from September and a 5% rise year-over-year. Ransomware activity dramatically escalated, with 801 reported attacks in October, a 48% surge compared to October 2024. The Qilin ransomware group was particularly active, responsible for a substantial portion of these incidents. Furthermore, the increasing use of AI by threat actors for sophisticated social engineering attacks, including deepfakes and vishing, is a growing concern, with 16% of reported cyber incidents over the past year leveraging AI tools. A critical trend observed in October was the high risk of sensitive data leakage through generative AI (GenAI) prompts within enterprise networks, impacting 87% of organizations regularly using GenAI tools. Third-party risk also remained a primary breach vector, exemplified by the CL0P ransomware group exploiting a critical vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Evaluate the effectiveness of current cybersecurity controls, particularly ransomware detection and response capabilities, third-party risk management frameworks, and data governance policies for AI/GenAI usage. Conduct simulated AI-enhanced phishing and vishing exercises to test employee awareness and incident response.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Increased financial losses from ransomware payments, business interruption, reputational damage, and potential regulatory fines due to data breaches, especially those involving sensitive data exposed through AI systems or third-party compromises.

### Evolving and Fragmented AI Regulatory Landscape
**Context**: The regulatory environment for Artificial Intelligence is rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly complex. In October 2025, California's new AI regulations took effect, mandating data retention for automated decision systems and bias testing in AI used for hiring. China is set to implement new national standards for generative AI in November 2025, focusing on security, governance, and ethics. While the EU AI Act's obligations for general-purpose AI models became effective in August 2025, the European Commission has proposed a pause and simplification to certain provisions, including a one-year "grace period" for companies, in response to industry pressure. Concurrently, the SEC launched an AI Task Force and appointed a Chief AI Officer in August 2025 to oversee AI-related disclosures and internal use. The EU Commission is also proposing changes to GDPR to facilitate AI data use and is investigating companies combining customer data with AI services.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Assess the organization's compliance with emerging AI regulations across relevant jurisdictions (e.g., California, EU, China, SEC guidance). Review AI governance frameworks, data retention policies, bias testing procedures for AI in critical functions (e.g., HR, customer service), and the transparency of AI-related disclosures.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Non-compliance could lead to significant legal penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruptions, particularly as regulatory bodies like the SEC increase scrutiny on AI governance and disclosures.

### Persistent Global Economic Volatility and Inflationary Pressures
**Context**: The global economic outlook remains subdued, with projections indicating a slowdown in global growth from 3.3% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026. The International Monetary Fund's October 2025 World Economic Outlook highlights downside risks stemming from prolonged uncertainty, increased protectionism, labor supply shocks, fiscal vulnerabilities, and potential financial market corrections. While global inflation is generally projected to decline, variations persist across countries. For instance, UK inflation eased to 3.6% in October 2025, potentially paving the way for interest rate cuts, yet food inflation accelerated to 4.9%. Similarly, Canada's CPI decelerated to 2.2% in October, but grocery prices remained elevated. Geopolitical tensions, including ongoing conflicts and trade barriers, continue to fuel regional instability and impact energy and food security, contributing to inflationary pressures and influencing global supply chains.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Evaluate the robustness of business continuity plans against macroeconomic shocks, including sustained inflation and potential interest rate fluctuations. Assess the impact of elevated food and energy prices on operational costs and consumer demand. Review financial forecasting models for accuracy in volatile economic conditions.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Reduced profitability, increased operational costs, potential for decreased consumer spending, and challenges in capital allocation and investment decisions due to economic uncertainty.

### Increasing Supply Chain Fragility and Geopolitical Disruption
**Context**: Global supply chains, particularly in Europe, are experiencing "extremely fragile" conditions, heavily influenced by geopolitical events and evolving trade policies. The period from October to November 2025 saw continued challenges from geopolitical instability, including ongoing issues in the Red Sea and potential risks in other strategic regions, which disrupt shipping routes and make planning more difficult. New trade regulations, such as the EU's Import Control System 2 (ICS2), Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), are set to come into effect in 2026, demanding significant adjustments for compliant and agile supply chains. Furthermore, the EU launched the Quantum Act in October 2025, aiming to strengthen supply-chain resilience for quantum technologies. The technology sector remains highly exposed to supply chain cyber risks, with nearly half of all breaches in 2025 involving technology products and services.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Review supply chain risk management strategies, including geopolitical risk assessments and contingency plans for disrupted routes and trade policy changes. Assess the organization's readiness for upcoming EU trade regulations (ICS2, CBAM, EUDR) and the impact on sourcing and logistics. Evaluate cybersecurity controls within the supply chain, especially for technology vendors and critical third-party providers.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Supply chain disruptions can lead to increased costs, production delays, inventory shortages, reputational damage, and potential loss of market share. Non-compliance with new trade regulations could result in significant fines and operational hurdles.

## Past Quarter

Here's a strategic analysis of broad trends and systemic shifts over the past quarter (August 20, 2025, to November 20, 2025), tailored for the Internal Audit Planning Committee.

### Accelerated and Fragmented AI & Data Privacy Regulation
**Context**: The past quarter witnessed a rapid evolution and increasing fragmentation in AI and data privacy regulations globally. The EU AI Act's General-Purpose AI (GPAI) rules became effective in August 2025, while the European Commission has proposed delaying the implementation of rules for high-risk AI systems until December 2027 and expanding exceptions for small and medium-sized businesses. Concurrently, China is implementing new national standards for generative AI, and California's new AI regulations, requiring bias testing and data retention for automated decision systems, took effect in October 2025. In data privacy, the EU Data Act came into force in September 2025, mandating user access to product-generated data and cloud provider switching. A patchwork of new state-level privacy laws also became effective across the US, including in Iowa, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Maryland, and New Jersey, creating a complex compliance landscape.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Audit Action**: Assess the organization's AI governance framework, including data input/output controls, bias detection mechanisms, and compliance with varying jurisdictional requirements (e.g., EU AI Act GPAI rules, California's AI regulations). Review data mapping and consent management processes for adherence to the EU Data Act and new US state privacy laws, particularly concerning sensitive data and "dark patterns."
*   **Risk Impact**: Increased legal and reputational risk from non-compliance with evolving AI and data privacy mandates, potential for significant fines, and operational disruption due to fragmented regulatory requirements.

### Advanced and Decentralized Cyber Threats
**Context**: Cyber threats have continued to intensify and diversify, with a notable increase in sophistication and decentralization. Ransomware activity remained at historically high levels in Q3 2025, with 1,592 new victims reported, and a significant trend towards fragmentation with 85 active groups and 14 new groups emerging in the quarter. Brand phishing attacks surged, with Microsoft being impersonated in 40% of all attempts, followed by Google and Apple. These phishing campaigns are increasingly AI-driven, hyper-personalized, and deceptive, making them nearly indistinguishable from legitimate communications. Small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) have become primary targets, experiencing a 32% rise in phishing campaigns.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Audit Action**: Evaluate the effectiveness of current cybersecurity controls against AI-driven phishing and advanced ransomware tactics, including employee training on recognizing sophisticated social engineering. Review incident response plans for decentralized and rapidly evolving threat actors, and assess the resilience of critical systems against sustained attacks.
*   **Risk Impact**: Elevated financial losses from ransomware payments and recovery, significant data breaches, reputational damage, and business interruption dueating to more sophisticated and pervasive cyberattacks.

### Persistent Macroeconomic Instability and Labor Market Rebalancing
**Context**: The global economy continues to face fragility, with projected deceleration in real GDP growth to 2.9% in 2025, influenced by geopolitical, economic, and climate risks. Inflation remains a concern, with US headline CPI accelerating for five consecutive months, reaching 3.0% in September 2025. In response to a cooling labor market, the Federal Reserve initiated its first interest rate cut of 25 basis points in September 2025, with further cuts anticipated. The US labor market showed signs of softening in Q3 2025, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.1-4.3% and employment growth slowing significantly to an average of 27,000 jobs per month since April. There is an increasing emphasis on skills over formal education in hiring.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Audit Action**: Assess the impact of persistent inflation and interest rate fluctuations on financial forecasts, capital expenditure, and debt servicing capabilities. Review business continuity plans for potential economic downturns and evaluate workforce planning strategies, including talent acquisition, retention, and skills development programs, in light of the evolving labor market.
*   **Risk Impact**: Pressure on profitability, increased cost of capital, potential for reduced consumer demand, and challenges in attracting and retaining skilled talent, impacting operational stability and strategic growth initiatives.

### Systemic Supply Chain Cyber Vulnerabilities
**Context**: Supply chain cyber attacks have become a critical and escalating threat, doubling in frequency in recent months to an average of 26 attacks per month since April 2025. The 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) highlighted that 30% of all breaches now involve a third party, a 100% increase from the previous year. The global annual cost of software supply chain attacks is projected to reach $60 billion in 2025. These attacks exploit the interconnectedness of digital infrastructure, turning supply chains into "ultimate force multipliers" for cybercriminals and nation-state actors. A notable event in Q3 2025 included a Salesforce supply chain attack that exposed over 5 million customer records.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Audit Action**: Conduct a comprehensive review of third-party risk management programs, focusing on the cybersecurity posture of critical vendors and n-tier suppliers. Evaluate the effectiveness of contractual clauses, security assessments, and continuous monitoring mechanisms for supply chain partners. Test incident response plans specifically for supply chain compromises.
*   **Risk Impact**: Severe operational disruptions, significant financial losses, intellectual property theft, and widespread reputational damage due to the exploitation of vulnerabilities within the extended supply chain ecosystem.

## Past Year

Here is a strategic analysis of broad trends and systemic shifts over the past year (November 20, 2024, to November 20, 2025), tailored for the Internal Audit Planning Committee.

### Evolving AI Regulatory Landscape
**Context**: The period from late 2024 through 2025 has seen a significant acceleration in AI regulation globally, particularly with the European Union's AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) entering into force on August 1, 2024. Key provisions of this landmark legislation, such as prohibitions on "unacceptable risk" AI systems (e.g., manipulative AI, social scoring, real-time biometric identification in public spaces) and AI literacy requirements, became applicable on February 2, 2025. Additionally, governance rules and obligations for General Purpose AI (GPAI) models became applicable on August 2, 2025. In the United States, while a comprehensive federal AI law is still absent, 2024 saw a surge in state-level legislative actions, including Colorado's law requiring developers of "high-risk" AI to prevent algorithmic bias and California's package of AI laws addressing deepfakes and transparency. The UK also announced intentions to establish legislation for powerful AI models in 2025.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Compliance with EU AI Act**: Audit AI system development, deployment, and usage for adherence to the EU AI Act's risk-based framework, focusing on prohibited practices, transparency requirements, data governance, and human oversight, especially for systems impacting EU citizens or markets.
*   **AI Governance and Ethics Frameworks**: Assess the organization's internal AI governance frameworks, ethical guidelines, and employee AI literacy programs to ensure they align with emerging global regulatory expectations and mitigate risks of bias, discrimination, and misuse.

### Escalation of Cyber Supply Chain Attacks and Ransomware
**Context**: Cyber threats have intensified significantly over the past year, with supply chain attacks doubling in 2024 compared to previous years and continuing to rise in 2025. These attacks exploit weaknesses in third-party vendors or suppliers to infiltrate target systems, as exemplified by the Sisense data breach and the XZ Backdoor incident in April 2024. Ransomware remains a top organizational cyber risk, with over 5,600 publicly disclosed attacks worldwide in 2024, and critical sectors such as healthcare, financial services, IT, and manufacturing remaining high-value targets. The average ransom payment fell to about $1.0 million in 2025, down by 50% from $2.0 million in 2024, but the frequency and sophistication of attacks, including the rise of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and a shift towards extortion, continue to pose significant threats. Infostealer malware attacks also surged by 58% in 2024, stealing credentials and sensitive data.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Third-Party Risk Management**: Conduct in-depth audits of third-party vendor security postures, contract clauses related to cybersecurity, and incident response plans, given that 30% of breaches now involve a third party.
*   **Ransomware Preparedness and Response**: Evaluate the effectiveness of ransomware detection, prevention, and recovery strategies, including robust backup and recovery systems, incident response playbooks, and employee training on phishing and social engineering, which are increasingly leveraging AI.

### Persistent Macroeconomic Headwinds and Geopolitical Fragmentation
**Context**: Businesses have continued to grapple with persistent macroeconomic headwinds and increasing geopolitical fragmentation throughout 2024 and 2025. Inflation has remained a top concern for businesses, particularly small businesses, impacting purchasing power, increasing material costs, and driving up labor expenses. Geopolitical upheaval, marked by ongoing conflicts in Europe (Russia-Ukraine) and the Middle East (Israel-Hamas), has fueled regional instability, disrupted global trade, and contributed to inflationary pressures and market volatility. The "super election year" of 2024, with over 70 countries holding elections, has also contributed to political instability and the rise of protectionist policies, further fragmenting global trade and supply chains.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Business Continuity and Resilience Planning**: Assess the organization's business continuity plans and supply chain resilience strategies against scenarios involving sustained inflation, energy price volatility, and geopolitical disruptions, including potential trade route blockages or sanctions.
*   **Financial Risk Management**: Review financial forecasting models, hedging strategies, and liquidity management in light of persistent inflation, fluctuating interest rates, and currency volatility, ensuring adequate capital and credit access.

### Strategic Restructuring of Global Supply Chains
**Context**: The past year has seen a significant long-term shift in supply chain strategies, moving away from purely globalized models towards greater regionalization, nearshoring, and reshoring. This trend is driven by a desire to mitigate risks from geopolitical tensions, reduce transportation costs, shorten lead times, and enhance responsiveness to market demands. Mexico, for instance, has emerged as a key nearshoring partner for US companies, particularly in manufacturing and IT. Concurrently, there's an intensified focus on securing critical minerals supply chains, which are vital for energy technologies and national security. The US Department of the Interior published its final 2025 List of Critical Minerals, expanding it to 60 essential commodities and highlighting vulnerabilities due to geographic concentration and single-supplier dependencies. Resource nationalism, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo banning cobalt exports in February 2025 and China restricting rare earth exports in December 2024, further underscores the need for diversification and domestic production.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Supply Chain Strategy and Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the organization's long-term supply chain strategy, including investments in regionalization, nearshoring, and diversification of suppliers, to ensure it effectively addresses geopolitical risks, material shortages, and logistics disruptions.
*   **Critical Minerals and Sourcing Resilience**: Audit the sourcing and inventory management of critical raw materials, particularly those identified as high-risk due to geopolitical factors or limited supply, and assess the effectiveness of strategies to secure access and reduce dependencies.
