### Corporate Scandal & Regulatory Fine: FirstEnergy's $250M Penalty
**Context**: The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) has ordered FirstEnergy's Ohio utilities (Toledo Edison, Ohio Edison, and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company) to pay a combined $250.7 million in restitution to customers and civil forfeitures. This action concludes PUCO's investigation into the utility's role in the House Bill 6 corruption scandal, which involved bribery and the misuse of funds intended for grid modernization to subsidize unregulated generation affiliates.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Conduct a comprehensive review of corporate governance, ethics programs, and compliance with regulatory orders, particularly concerning the allocation of funds, lobbying activities, and separation between regulated and unregulated entities.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Substantial financial penalties, mandated customer restitution, reputational damage, and potential for ongoing regulatory oversight and enforcement actions.

### Operational Disruption: Widespread Asia-Pacific Airline Delays & Cancellations
**Context**: Asia's aviation network is experiencing significant operational disruptions, with 72 cancellations and 423 delays reported across major carriers including Air China, China Express Airlines, and Batik Air. These disruptions, affecting key hubs like Beijing, Jakarta, Sapporo, and Guangzhou, are attributed to a combination of capacity constraints, operational complexity, and volatile weather patterns across the region. Separately, Dubai International Airport also faced disruptions due to dense fog, leading to the diversion of 19 inbound flights.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Evaluate business continuity plans, supply chain resilience, and operational risk management strategies, especially for organizations reliant on global logistics and air travel. Assess the impact of external factors like weather and infrastructure limitations on operational efficiency.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Financial losses due to disrupted supply chains, increased operational costs, customer dissatisfaction, and potential for contractual penalties related to service level agreements.

## Past Month

Here are the key broad trends and systemic shifts observed over the past month (October 20, 2025, to November 20, 2025), along with their implications for internal audit planning.

### Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny on AI and Data Privacy
**Context**: The regulatory landscape for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data privacy has significantly evolved. California's new AI regulations, effective October 1, 2025, now require employers to retain automated decision systems data for four years and conduct bias testing when using AI in hiring and promotions, extending liability to third-party AI vendors for discriminatory outcomes. Concurrently, Maryland's Online Data Privacy Act (MODPA) also took effect on October 1, 2025, establishing a stringent framework that prohibits the sale of sensitive data without consent and mandates that data collection be "strictly necessary" for requested services. Globally, India has operationalized its first comprehensive digital privacy law with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules 2025, notified on November 14, 2025, introducing phased obligations over the next 12-18 months.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Audit the organization's AI governance framework, including data retention policies, bias testing methodologies for AI-driven decisions (especially in HR), and third-party AI vendor contracts for compliance with new liability provisions. Review data collection and processing practices to ensure adherence to "strictly necessary" principles and consent requirements, particularly for sensitive data.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Non-compliance could lead to significant legal penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruptions, especially given the aggressive enforcement actions seen in some jurisdictions (e.g., Texas AG's letters to data brokers).

### Escalation of Cyber Threats: Ransomware and Supply Chain Attacks
**Context**: October 2025 witnessed a dramatic surge in cyber attacks, with global organizations experiencing an average of 1,938 attacks per week, a 5% increase year-over-year. Ransomware activity escalated significantly, with 801 reported attacks, marking a 48% surge compared to October 2024, and a 41% month-on-month increase in recorded incidents. North America and Europe were primary targets, and the Industrials and Healthcare sectors were particularly impacted. Concurrently, software supply chain attacks reached a new record high in October 2025, driven by the exploitation of critical and zero-day vulnerabilities in SaaS and IT service providers. Notable incidents include the Cl0p threat group exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Oracle's E-Business Suite (CVE-2025-61882) and a nation-state threat actor maintaining long-term access to F5's systems, stealing BIG-IP source code. The increasing use of generative AI (GenAI) tools in enterprises has also introduced new risks, with 1 in every 44 GenAI prompts posing a high risk of sensitive data leakage.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Conduct targeted audits of ransomware preparedness and response plans, including data backup and recovery, incident response playbooks, and employee training on phishing and social engineering. Intensify third-party risk assessments, focusing on the cybersecurity posture of critical vendors and SaaS providers, and review the security of Oracle E-Business Suite implementations. Evaluate the controls around GenAI tool usage to prevent sensitive data leakage.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: The escalating volume and sophistication of these attacks pose a severe threat to business continuity, data integrity, and financial stability, with potential for significant financial losses, operational downtime, and regulatory fines.

### Persistent Global Economic Uncertainty and Inflationary Pressures
**Context**: The global economy is navigating a "precarious position" in November 2025, characterized by geopolitical crosswinds, policy fragmentation, and structural shifts. While global real GDP growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 have seen slight upward revisions, the overall outlook remains uncertain, with growth expected to be below pre-pandemic levels. Inflationary pressures continue to be a concern in advanced economies, with the UK's Consumer Prices Index (CPI) at 3.6% in October 2025 and the euro area at 2.1%. The longest US government shutdown has concluded, but its lingering effects contribute to economic uncertainty. Furthermore, the increasing dominance of fiscal expansion and industrial policy is anticipated to contribute to structurally higher inflation and rising debt burdens.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Assess the organization's business continuity plans against various macroeconomic scenarios, including prolonged inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical instability. Review financial forecasting models for sensitivity to inflation and interest rate fluctuations. Evaluate the impact of potential trade tariffs and policy fragmentation on revenue streams and operational costs.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Macroeconomic volatility can impact profitability, investment decisions, and access to capital, potentially leading to financial instability and hindering strategic growth initiatives.

### Strategic Restructuring of Global Supply Chains
**Context**: The past month has highlighted a significant shift in global supply chain strategies, moving beyond traditional reshoring efforts. Reshoring to the US is largely stagnant for small and mid-sized manufacturers due to economic instability. Instead, nearshoring, particularly to Mexico, is gaining substantial momentum. This is driven by Mexico's significant cost advantages, including wage differentials of up to 80%, its proximity to US markets, lower tariffs, and USMCA duty-free pathways, coupled with increasing government support for manufacturing. This trend aims to improve response times, mitigate geopolitical risks, and enhance control over supply chains. Additionally, geopolitical tensions are actively reshaping critical minerals supply chains, as evidenced by a late October 2025 deal with China addressing export restrictions on key materials, and similar cooperation with Japan on rare earths, signaling a move towards coordinated industrial policy for resilience.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Evaluate the organization's supply chain strategy for alignment with nearshoring trends, particularly if operations are heavily reliant on distant manufacturing or sourcing. Assess the resilience of critical mineral supply chains, considering geopolitical risks and the impact of new trade agreements or restrictions. Review supplier diversification strategies and the effectiveness of long-term partnerships in mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Failure to adapt to these long-term supply chain restructuring trends can lead to increased operational costs, extended lead times, reduced competitiveness, and exposure to geopolitical risks.

## Past Quarter

Here's an analysis of broad trends and systemic shifts over the past quarter (August 20, 2025, to November 20, 2025), presented for the Internal Audit Planning Committee.

### Fragmented AI Regulatory Landscape
**Context**: The past quarter has seen a significant acceleration and fragmentation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulatory efforts globally, particularly in the United States. While the EU AI Act, adopted in mid-2024, is set to be fully enforced by August 2026 with a risk-based approach, the U.S. federal government has stepped back from a unified approach. In July 2025, the U.S. Senate removed a proposed federal moratorium on state and local AI regulation, leaving states to become the primary regulators. This has led to a patchwork of state-specific laws, such as Colorado's comprehensive risk-based AI Act (effective February 2026) and California's AI Transparency Act (effective January 2026), alongside targeted legislation in other states. This divergence creates a complex compliance environment for organizations operating across multiple jurisdictions.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Audit the organization's AI governance framework, assessing its ability to identify, categorize, and manage AI systems based on varying risk levels and compliance requirements across different operating regions (e.g., EU's "high-risk" AI systems, U.S. state-specific mandates). This includes reviewing data governance, transparency mechanisms, human oversight protocols, and conformity assessments for AI deployments.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Non-compliance with evolving AI regulations could lead to significant legal penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruptions, especially concerning algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the ethical use of AI. The absence of a single federal standard in the U.S. increases the complexity and cost of compliance for multinational entities.

### Escalating and Fragmented Ransomware Threat
**Context**: Ransomware activity has remained at historically high levels in Q3 2025, with 1,592 new victims reported across 85 active data leak sites, representing a 25% year-over-year increase compared to Q3 2024. A significant trend is the increasing fragmentation and decentralization of the ransomware ecosystem, with a record 85 active groups observed in Q3 2025 and 14 new ransomware brands launched this quarter. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) continue to be primary targets, experiencing a 32% rise in phishing campaigns between July and September 2025, often leveraging AI for more sophisticated attacks. Notable incidents in August 2025 included a statewide attack on Nevada and significant breaches affecting healthcare providers like DaVita, compromising sensitive patient data.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Conduct targeted audits of incident response plans, data backup and recovery strategies, and third-party vendor cybersecurity controls, particularly for SMBs within the supply chain. Evaluate the effectiveness of anti-phishing training programs and the organization's ability to detect and respond to AI-generated phishing attempts and Business Email Compromise (BEC) schemes.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: The persistent and fragmented nature of ransomware, coupled with sophisticated phishing tactics, poses a severe threat to business continuity, data integrity, and financial stability. The average downtime after a ransomware attack is 24 days, and while average ransom payments have decreased, the overall volume and impact remain high, especially for critical infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.

### Geopolitical Trade Tensions and Supply Chain Re-alignment
**Context**: The global macroeconomic environment in Q3 2025 was significantly shaped by divergent regional trends and escalating geopolitical and policymaking uncertainties, particularly concerning trade. New U.S. tariffs, largely effective from August 7, 2025, have impacted global trade costs and prompted a re-evaluation of sourcing strategies. The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report identifies armed conflict and trade conflict as top risks for 2025, disrupting trade routes and impacting critical material availability. This has led to a long-term trend of supply chain restructuring, with companies prioritizing risk mitigation, continuity, and resilience over pure cost optimization, exploring nearshoring and diversifying supplier portfolios.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Review the organization's supply chain risk management framework, focusing on the identification and mitigation of geopolitical and trade policy risks. This includes assessing multi-tier supplier visibility, the agility of sourcing and transportation routes, and the impact of potential tariff changes on operational costs and business continuity.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Escalating trade conflicts and geopolitical instability can lead to increased operational costs, supply chain disruptions, and reduced access to critical resources. The shift towards regionalization and diversified sourcing, while enhancing resilience, may also introduce new cost structures and require significant capital investment.

### Macroeconomic Volatility and Business Continuity
**Context**: The third quarter of 2025 was characterized by a mix of economic resilience and policy recalibration, but with lingering uncertainties. While global growth proved resilient, the U.S. economy showed signs of slowing, with job growth easing and unemployment edging higher, even as inflation ticked up again. This prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to restart rate cuts in September 2025 after a nine-month pause. Concerns around stagflation (slowing job growth and sticky inflation) have emerged. Furthermore, the ongoing impact of new tariffs and trade policy uncertainty continues to pose risks to business investment and global demand, with the World Bank projecting weaker global growth if trade restrictions escalate.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **Specific audit action or area to test**: Evaluate the organization's financial forecasting and liquidity management in light of potential interest rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures. Assess the robustness of business continuity plans to address potential disruptions from economic slowdowns, shifts in consumer demand, and increased operational costs due to tariffs.
*   **Risk impact consideration**: Macroeconomic volatility, including persistent inflation and potential stagflation, can impact profitability, investment decisions, and consumer spending. Businesses need to be agile in adapting to changing economic conditions, as complacency regarding inflation and tariff impacts could lead to underestimated risks to corporate profit margins and aggregate demand.
