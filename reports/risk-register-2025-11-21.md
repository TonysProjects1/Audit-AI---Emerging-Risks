## Past Day

Here is a news-brief style summary of recent events affecting Northwestern Mutual, its mutual peers, or the Financial Services sector, strictly within the date range of November 20-21, 2025.

### EEOC Subpoena Enforcement Action Against Northwestern Mutual
**Context**: On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a subpoena enforcement action in federal court against Northwestern Mutual. The action seeks to compel the company to provide information regarding its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies and practices. This stems from a discrimination investigation initiated by the agency following a charge filed by a Northwestern Mutual compliance officer in March, alleging discriminatory DEI practices.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Directly impacts Northwestern Mutual's corporate reputation and could lead to significant legal and financial costs.
*   Raises questions about the implementation and oversight of internal DEI initiatives, potentially affecting employee morale and talent acquisition.
*   Could result in regulatory scrutiny of HR and compliance functions related to employment practices.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review the design and operating effectiveness of HR policies and controls related to DEI programs and promotion processes.
*   Assess the legal and compliance department's handling of discrimination complaints and regulatory inquiries.
*   Audit internal communication and documentation practices surrounding DEI initiatives.

### Commercial Real Estate Market Headwinds
**Context**: Recent reports indicate a weakening sentiment in the commercial real estate (CRE) market. Builder sentiment dipped in November 2025 due to economic uncertainty and buyer hesitation, with a record 41% of builders reporting price cuts. Additionally, New York City rent-stabilized landlords are facing increased pressure from soaring insurance costs. The broader CRE market recovery post-shutdown shows a sector divide, with industrial properties performing strongly while office properties continue to struggle. Concurrently, US Treasury bond yields (10-year and 20-year) eased slightly on November 21, 2025, after some upward movement over the past month.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Affects the performance and valuation of commercial real estate investments within the General Account, potentially impacting solvency and dividend performance.
*   Increased insurance costs for landlords could signal broader market stress, affecting property income and investment returns.
*   Weakening builder sentiment and office market struggles may indicate broader economic slowdowns or shifts that could impact client wealth and demand for financial products.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Audit the valuation methodologies and impairment assessments for commercial real estate holdings in the General Account.
*   Review investment portfolio stress testing scenarios, particularly those related to adverse CRE market conditions and bond yield fluctuations.
*   Assess risk management frameworks for exposure to specific CRE sub-sectors, such as office properties.

### Persistent Cybersecurity Threats to the Financial Services Sector
**Context**: The financial services sector continues to face significant cybersecurity risks, with recent data breaches affecting insurers and third-party administrators (TPAs). LP Insurance Services disclosed a data breach where sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) were exposed, with notifications sent out starting October 20, 2025, for an incident that occurred in March 2025. Similarly, Vidal Health Insurance TPA suffered a cyber incident impacting its systems, exposing patient names, insurance details, and medical information, as reported on October 23, 2025. A class action settlement related to a February 2024 data breach at Prudential Financial also had a claim deadline of November 17, 2025, highlighting ongoing repercussions from past incidents.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Directly impacts the security of client data across all product lines (Whole Life, Term, DI, LTC, Annuities, Advisory Services).
*   Increases operational risk, reputational damage, and potential regulatory fines if Northwestern Mutual or its TPAs experience a breach.
*   Highlights the critical importance of robust third-party vendor management for TPAs and other service providers.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity controls, including incident response plans and data encryption, for both internal systems and third-party vendors.
*   Audit vendor management programs, focusing on the cybersecurity posture and data protection practices of TPAs and other critical service providers.
*   Review data privacy compliance programs in light of recent breaches and evolving regulatory expectations.

### Continued Regulatory Scrutiny on Sales Practices and Communications
**Context**: Regulatory bodies like the SEC and FINRA maintain a strong focus on sales practices, "best interest" (Reg BI) compliance, and the proper recording of communications. While the SEC's specific "off-channel communications sweep" under a previous administration concluded in January 2025, SEC staff continue to request production of off-channel communications in investigations of other substantive issues. A report from November 19, 2025, indicated a 30% drop in SEC enforcement actions against public companies and subsidiaries in FY 2025, coinciding with a change in SEC administration, but noted the continued interest in addressing off-channel communications. FINRA has also continued to bring enforcement actions related to Reg BI, with several cases in October 2025 citing failures to establish adequate written policies, procedures, and supervisory systems, particularly concerning complex products.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Impacts the compliance burden and supervisory requirements for Northwestern Mutual Investment Services (NMIS) and its exclusive "Career Agency" system (Financial Representatives).
*   Potential for enforcement actions and fines related to sales practices, suitability, and recordkeeping, especially concerning off-channel communications and Reg BI adherence.
*   Requires continuous reinforcement of training and monitoring for Financial Representatives to ensure adherence to communication and sales practice rules.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review NMIS supervisory controls and monitoring programs for compliance with Reg BI, especially for recommendations of complex products.
*   Audit policies and procedures related to the use of approved communication channels and the retention of business-related communications by Financial Representatives.
*   Assess the effectiveness of training programs for the field force on sales practices and regulatory compliance.

## Past Week

Here is a news brief for Northwestern Mutual's Internal Audit Planning Committee & Risk Committee, covering the past week (November 14-21, 2025):

### Market Volatility: Rising Bond Yields and Tech Sector Pullback
**Context**: Global financial markets experienced a "repricing phase" during the week, characterized by higher bond yields and a significant pullback in the technology sector. On November 14, 2025, global markets turned defensive as investors digested fading expectations for near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts. Treasury yields were largely unchanged but poised to finish the week higher, with the 10-year note at 4.14% and the 30-year note at 4.74% on November 14, 2025. This shift was also influenced by a reevaluation of high-valuation technology names and renewed caution regarding China's economic outlook.
**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Affects General Account investment performance, particularly fixed income portfolios and rate-sensitive assets.
*   Impacts the valuation of equity holdings, especially in technology-heavy sectors.
*   Could influence client sentiment and demand for interest-rate-sensitive products like annuities.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review General Account investment strategy and portfolio sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations.
*   Audit asset-liability management (ALM) models for robustness against sustained higher yield environments.
*   Assess investment risk management frameworks for equity and fixed income exposures.

### Cybersecurity Settlements Impacting Peer Insurers
**Context**: Two significant class action settlements related to past data breaches involving peer financial institutions saw key deadlines within the past week. Prudential Financial agreed to pay $4.75 million to resolve a class action lawsuit stemming from a February 2024 hacking incident, with the claim submission deadline for affected individuals being November 17, 2025. Similarly, Pacific Guardian Life Insurance Company is settling a class action lawsuit over an August 2023 data breach, with the opt-out deadline for class members set for November 21, 2025. These settlements highlight the ongoing financial and reputational costs associated with cybersecurity incidents in the insurance sector.
**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Reinforces the critical importance of robust cybersecurity defenses and incident response capabilities for protecting client data.
*   Highlights potential financial and reputational exposure from data breaches, including class action litigation.
*   Emphasizes the need for strong third-party vendor management, as breaches often originate through external partners.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Audit the effectiveness of cybersecurity controls, including penetration testing and vulnerability management.
*   Review the incident response plan and data breach notification procedures.
*   Assess third-party vendor management programs, especially for those handling sensitive client information.

### New York Life Faces Lawsuits Over Product Charges and Retirement Plans
**Context**: A subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Co., a major mutual peer, is facing a lawsuit filed in October 2025 alleging it failed to incorporate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 into universal life cost-of-insurance charges. Separately, New York Life Insurance Company agreed to a $19 million settlement in an ERISA class action lawsuit concerning the company's use of its own investment products in its 401(k) plans, with an update on this settlement noted on November 17, 2025. These cases underscore ongoing legal scrutiny of product design, pricing, and fiduciary responsibilities within the life insurance and wealth management industries.
**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Directly relevant to the design and administration of Whole Life and Annuity products, particularly regarding cost-of-insurance calculations and dividend performance.
*   Highlights potential regulatory and legal risks associated with proprietary investment offerings within advisory services (NMIS) and employee retirement plans.
*   Could influence client expectations and competitive pressures regarding product transparency and value.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review product governance processes for Whole Life and Annuity products, including pricing assumptions and compliance with tax law changes.
*   Audit NMIS supervisory controls and disclosures related to proprietary investment products.
*   Assess fiduciary oversight of employee retirement plans and investment selection processes.

### Increased Regulatory Scrutiny on AI Risks in Financial Services
**Context**: On November 15, 2025, Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr emphasized the need for central banks to accelerate responsible AI adoption internally and flagged key risks in financial services. These risks include bias, model explainability, and potential market stability issues arising from AI-driven strategies. This statement signals a growing regulatory focus on the responsible development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence within the financial sector.
**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Impacts the development and use of AI in client experience, digital transformation, and integrated financial planning initiatives.
*   Creates a need for robust model governance frameworks to address potential biases, ensure explainability, and manage operational risks associated with AI.
*   Could lead to future regulatory guidance or enforcement actions related to AI ethics and risk management.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Audit model governance frameworks for AI applications, focusing on data quality, bias detection, and explainability.
*   Review the ethical guidelines and risk management processes for AI development and deployment across the organization.
*   Assess the adequacy of controls for AI systems that impact client decisions or financial stability.

## Past Month

Here is a strategic analysis of broad trends and systemic shifts relevant to Northwestern Mutual over the past month (October 21, 2025, to November 21, 2025), tailored for the Internal Audit Planning Committee & Risk Committee.

### Regulatory Uncertainty in DOL Fiduciary Rule
**Context**: The Department of Labor's (DOL) "Retirement Security Rule," which expanded ERISA fiduciary duties to one-time advice like rollovers and annuity purchases, remains a source of regulatory uncertainty, currently facing legal challenges. A potential change in administration by late 2025 could lead to a new final rule by May 2026, likely rolling back or rewriting the existing rule to align with deregulation goals and potentially reversing positions on ESG and cryptocurrency investments. This creates a highly fluid regulatory environment for financial advice.
**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**: This directly impacts Northwestern Mutual Investment Services (NMIS) and the advice provided by Financial Representatives, particularly concerning retirement rollovers and annuity sales. The shifting landscape could necessitate frequent adjustments to compliance frameworks and advisor training, affecting the integrated financial planning strategic focus.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review NMIS supervisory controls and compliance programs for adaptability to evolving fiduciary standards.
*   Assess training and communication strategies for Financial Representatives regarding changes in advice standards for retirement assets.
*   Evaluate the impact of potential rule changes on product offerings and sales practices for annuities and investment products.

### AI Governance and Ethical Risks in Financial Advice & Underwriting
**Context**: The rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in financial services, including underwriting and financial advice, presents significant ethical and governance challenges. Regulators like the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) are actively developing comprehensive frameworks and model laws to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems, with a focus on mitigating bias and addressing adverse outcomes. Concerns about bias in AI-driven decisions and the need for explainable AI are prominent discussions within the industry.
**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**: As a firm focused on client experience and digital transformation, Northwestern Mutual is likely leveraging AI in underwriting (e.g., using electronic health records for faster assessments) and potentially in financial planning tools. This exposes the company to risks of algorithmic bias, data privacy breaches, and regulatory non-compliance, directly impacting client trust and solvency.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Audit model governance frameworks for AI used in underwriting and financial advice, focusing on bias detection, fairness, and explainability.
*   Assess data privacy and security controls for AI systems, especially those utilizing sensitive client data like electronic health records.
*   Review compliance with emerging NAIC AI governance guidelines and internal ethical AI principles.

### Intensifying Direct-to-Consumer Competition and Shifts in Distribution Models
**Context**: The direct-to-consumer (D2C) insurance model continues to gain market share, driven by increasing consumer comfort with online purchases and the efficiency offered by digital platforms. Insurers are leveraging technology for personalization and faster processing, bypassing traditional intermediaries. This trend is expected to intensify, posing challenges for traditional agency-based distribution models.
**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**: Northwestern Mutual's exclusive "Career Agency" system is a core differentiator. The rise of D2C models and digital-first competitors could challenge the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of this distribution model, impacting client acquisition, retention, and overall market share, especially for younger, digitally-native consumers.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the effectiveness and strategic alignment of the "Career Agency" model in the face of growing D2C competition.
*   Assess investments and strategies for digital client engagement and acquisition, ensuring they complement or enhance the agency system.
*   Review market analysis and competitive intelligence processes to understand shifts in consumer preferences and competitor strategies.

### Uncertainty in Federal Estate Tax Exemptions
**Context**: The federal estate tax exemption is projected to increase to an historically high $13.99 million per individual in 2025 but is scheduled to be cut in half to approximately $7 million in 2026 due to the sunset of provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). However, ongoing political discussions and potential new legislation (e.g., the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act") could permanently extend or even further increase these exemptions, creating significant uncertainty for long-term estate planning. Additionally, changes to Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from inherited retirement accounts are taking effect in 2025.
**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**: As a wealth management firm, Northwestern Mutual's advisory services, particularly in estate planning, are directly impacted. The fluctuating exemption amounts create complexity for high-net-worth clients and their financial representatives, affecting wealth transfer strategies, gifting opportunities, and the demand for products like whole life insurance used in estate planning.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review the guidance and training provided to Financial Representatives on current and anticipated estate tax law changes.
*   Assess the firm's communication strategy to clients regarding proactive estate planning in light of legislative uncertainty.
*   Evaluate the impact of these tax changes on the demand for and design of wealth transfer products and services.

### Deepfake Technology and Fraud Verification
**Context**: The advancement of deepfake technology poses a growing threat in financial fraud, enabling sophisticated identity theft, phishing, and unauthorized transactions. Financial institutions are increasingly targeted, necessitating robust defense strategies. The industry is responding by implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), liveness detection, behavioral biometrics, and advanced AI-powered fraud detection systems to verify identities and detect synthetic media.
**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**: As a financial services firm handling sensitive client information and transactions, Northwestern Mutual is vulnerable to deepfake-enabled fraud, particularly in client onboarding, account access, and high-value transactions. This risk impacts client trust, financial security, and the firm's reputation.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Audit the effectiveness of identity verification processes, particularly for digital onboarding and high-risk transactions, against deepfake threats.
*   Assess the implementation and efficacy of anti-deepfake technologies, such as liveness detection and advanced biometrics.
*   Review employee training programs on identifying and responding to deepfake-related social engineering attempts.

## Past Quarter

Here are the key trends and systemic shifts observed over the past quarter (August 21, 2025, to November 21, 2025) relevant to Northwestern Mutual, analyzed for the Internal Audit Planning Committee and Risk Committee.

### Regulatory Scrutiny and Ethical Risks of AI in Insurance
**Context**: The regulatory landscape for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the insurance sector is rapidly evolving. As of March 2025, 24 states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Model Bulletin on the Use of AI Systems by insurers, with ongoing discussions within the NAIC's Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Working Group to develop comprehensive regulatory frameworks and model laws. These efforts aim to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI applications, particularly in critical areas like underwriting, pricing, and claims. Concurrently, financial advisors are expressing significant concerns about the compliance risks associated with AI tools, as existing regulations may not clearly address these new technologies. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has also highlighted the increasing reliance on AI as a mounting risk to the financial system.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Impacts the development, deployment, and governance of AI across Northwestern Mutual's operations, including product development, underwriting for Whole Life, Term, Disability Income (DI), and Long-Term Care (LTC), as well as claims processing.
*   Increases NMIS regulatory exposure due to the use of AI in financial advice and integrated financial planning, necessitating robust compliance frameworks.
*   Potential for reputational damage, consumer harm, and regulatory penalties if AI systems are found to be biased, opaque, or non-compliant with emerging standards.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Conduct an audit of AI model governance frameworks, focusing on data input integrity, algorithm design, bias detection and mitigation strategies, and model explainability.
*   Review compliance with adopted state-level AI regulations and monitor developments from the NAIC and other federal bodies.
*   Assess NMIS's supervisory controls and training programs for Financial Representatives regarding the ethical and compliant use of AI tools in client interactions and advice delivery.

### Escalating Deepfake and AI-Powered Fraud
**Context**: The past quarter has seen a significant escalation in deepfake and AI-powered fraud schemes targeting financial services. Deepfake technology, which generates convincing AI-created images, videos, and audio, is being used by fraudsters to impersonate real individuals with remarkable accuracy. According to Veriff's Fraud Report 2025, fraud attempts grew by 21% between 2024 and 2025, with deepfakes implicated in 1 in 5 biometric fraud attempts. These sophisticated tactics are employed for account takeovers, social engineering, and voice cloning, making it increasingly difficult for institutions to distinguish legitimate users from malicious actors.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Poses a direct and severe threat to client asset security and the integrity of identity verification processes for new account openings, policy servicing, and high-value transactions across all product lines.
*   Increases the risk of fraudulent claims for life, disability, and long-term care products through sophisticated impersonation.
*   Could erode client trust and cause significant financial losses, impacting the company's reputation and operational resilience.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of current fraud detection systems and controls against deepfake and AI-powered impersonation, particularly in digital channels, call centers, and client onboarding.
*   Assess the implementation and efficacy of advanced biometric authentication and continuous identity verification (IDV) technologies.
*   Review incident response plans and employee training programs to address the evolving nature of AI-driven fraud.

### Impact of Social and Economic Inflation on Claims and Expenses
**Context**: The insurance industry continues to grapple with the persistent effects of social and economic inflation. Social inflation, characterized by rising claims costs due to increased litigation, higher jury awards (including "nuclear verdicts" exceeding $10 million), and a growing public skepticism towards large corporations, is pushing claims severity beyond traditional economic inflation. Simultaneously, general inflation and ongoing supply chain disruptions contribute to elevated costs for repairs, replacements, and services, directly impacting claims payouts and operational expenses. Furthermore, the potential for new tariffs could exacerbate materials inflation, particularly affecting property and auto insurance claims.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Directly impacts the profitability and solvency of Disability Income (DI) and Long-Term Care (LTC) products through increased claims costs and longer claim durations.
*   Affects the General Account's investment performance and, consequently, Whole Life dividend performance, if investment returns do not adequately offset rising claims and operational expenses.
*   Increases the cost of doing business, including administrative expenses, technology investments, and vendor management.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review actuarial assumptions and reserving methodologies for DI and LTC products to ensure they adequately account for social inflation trends and increased claims severity.
*   Assess the effectiveness of expense management strategies and procurement practices in mitigating the impact of general inflation and supply chain disruptions.
*   Evaluate pricing strategies and product design to ensure long-term sustainability in an environment of rising claims and operational costs.

### Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Portfolio Stress
**Context**: The commercial real estate (CRE) sector remains a significant area of concern, with ongoing stress observed over the past quarter. Elevated interest rates, coupled with a substantial "wall of debt maturities" totaling an estimated $1.8 trillion by 2026, are creating a challenging environment for property owners. Many borrowers who secured debt at lower rates now face refinancing at significantly higher costs, increasing the risk of default and distressed sales. Floating-rate syndication deals from 2021-2022 are particularly vulnerable to these rising debt service costs. While some lenders are extending terms, the sheer volume of upcoming maturities could overwhelm market capacity.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   As a major mutual life insurer and wealth management firm, Northwestern Mutual holds a substantial Commercial Mortgage Loan (CML) portfolio within its General Account.
*   Increased stress in the CRE market could lead to higher loan defaults, lower asset valuations, and potential impairments, directly impacting the solvency and investment performance of the General Account.
*   Could affect the company's overall financial strength ratings and ability to meet long-term obligations.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Conduct a focused audit of the CML portfolio, examining loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage, maturity schedules, and the adequacy of stress testing scenarios.
*   Review risk management practices related to CRE exposures, including concentration limits, portfolio diversification, and valuation methodologies for potentially distressed assets.
*   Assess the effectiveness of internal controls over loan origination, underwriting, and ongoing monitoring of CRE investments.

### Estate Tax Law Changes and Wealth Transfer Planning
**Context**: A significant legislative development in the past quarter was the signing into law of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA) on July 4, 2025. This act permanently increased the federal estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million per individual (or $30 million for married couples), effective January 1, 2026, with annual inflation adjustments. This substantial increase in the exemption amount is expected to dramatically reduce the number of estates subject to federal estate tax.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   While generally favorable for high-net-worth clients, this change alters the landscape for estate planning strategies, potentially reducing the perceived need for certain types of life insurance products traditionally used for estate liquidity or tax planning.
*   Could impact sales of Whole Life and other permanent insurance products, requiring adjustments to product positioning and sales narratives.
*   Influences the demand for and nature of advisory services provided by Financial Representatives, particularly in integrated financial planning and wealth transfer solutions.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review product development and marketing strategies to ensure they are aligned with the new estate tax environment and effectively communicate the ongoing value of life insurance beyond estate tax liquidity.
*   Assess the training, resources, and guidance provided to Financial Representatives to ensure they are equipped to advise clients effectively under the revised tax laws and to identify new planning opportunities.
*   Evaluate the impact of these changes on long-term sales projections and financial planning models.

## Past Year

Here's an analysis of broad trends and systemic shifts relevant to Northwestern Mutual over the past year (November 21, 2024, to November 21, 2025), tailored for the Internal Audit Planning Committee and Risk Committee.

### Evolving Regulatory Landscape for Fiduciary Advice and AI Governance
**Context**: The Department of Labor (DOL) issued a final rule on April 23, 2024, expanding the definition of an "investment advice fiduciary" under ERISA, which broadened the scope to include one-time recommendations for IRA rollovers. While its implementation was stayed by federal judges in July 2024, and litigation is anticipated, the intent to expand fiduciary scope remains. Concurrently, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) adopted a Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Systems by insurers in December 2023, which 24 states had adopted by March 2025. This bulletin mandates written AI programs covering governance, consumer notice, risk management, internal controls, and vendor management, with a focus on preventing unfair discrimination.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   **DOL Fiduciary Rule**: Impacts NMIS regulatory exposure and the compliance requirements for Financial Representatives providing investment advice, particularly concerning retirement account rollovers. The ongoing legal challenges create uncertainty but necessitate preparedness for potential future enforcement.
*   **NAIC AI Governance**: Directly affects all aspects of Northwestern Mutual's insurance operations, from product development and underwriting to claims and fraud detection, requiring robust AI governance frameworks to ensure compliance and prevent unfair practices.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   **DOL Fiduciary Rule**: Review NMIS supervisory controls and training programs for Financial Representatives regarding investment advice, especially for IRA rollovers, to ensure alignment with potential future regulatory interpretations. Assess the impact of the rule's stay and any interim guidance on current practices.
*   **NAIC AI Governance**: Audit the development, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of the enterprise-wide AI governance program, including risk assessments, internal controls, consumer notice procedures, and third-party vendor management for AI systems. Focus on controls designed to prevent algorithmic bias and ensure fair treatment of policyholders.

### Escalating Deepfake and AI-Powered Fraud
**Context**: Deepfake technology has rapidly evolved, becoming a significant tool for financial crime. Veriff's Fraud Reports indicate a 21% increase in deepfake attempts between 2024 and 2025, with financial losses from deepfake-enabled scams reaching $410 million in the first half of 2025 alone. Attackers are using AI-generated voices and videos to impersonate executives, trick employees, and bypass identity verification systems, with voice cloning possible from as little as 20-30 seconds of audio. The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act, enforceable from August 2025, classifies deepfakes as high-risk.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Directly impacts fraud verification processes, client authentication, and internal security protocols, posing a significant threat to client assets and company reputation.
*   Increases operational risk through potential for sophisticated social engineering attacks targeting employees and Financial Representatives.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Audit fraud detection and prevention systems, particularly those related to identity verification and transaction authorization, for their ability to detect sophisticated deepfake attacks.
*   Assess employee training and awareness programs regarding deepfake threats and social engineering tactics.
*   Review incident response plans for deepfake-related fraud events.

### Shifts in Estate Planning Tax Laws
**Context**: The increased federal estate and gift tax exemptions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 were scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025. However, on July 4, 2025, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA) was signed into law, permanently increasing the federal lifetime gift, estate, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax exemptions to $15 million per individual (or $30 million for married couples) starting January 1, 2026, with future increases indexed for inflation. The annual federal gift tax exclusion also increased to $19,000 per person in 2025.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Significantly impacts wealth management and estate planning strategies for high-net-worth clients, potentially altering demand for certain products like whole life insurance used for estate liquidity.
*   Requires Financial Representatives to be up-to-date on the latest tax law changes to provide accurate and relevant advice to clients.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review the training and communication provided to Financial Representatives regarding the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and its implications for estate and gift tax planning.
*   Assess the suitability of current product offerings and advisory services in light of these permanent tax law changes and their impact on client needs.

### Commercial Mortgage Loan (CML) Portfolio Refinancing Risk
**Context**: The U.S. insurance industry's commercial mortgage loan (CML) portfolio experienced increased refinancing risk at year-end 2024, with approximately one-third of commercial mortgages scheduled to mature within the next three years. While life insurers' CML portfolios are generally considered high quality and perform better than those of other investor groups, the office property sector continues to face challenges. The total commercial real estate (CRE) exposure for U.S. insurers exceeded $1 trillion at year-end 2024.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   As a major mutual life insurer, Northwestern Mutual holds significant CML investments in its General Account, making it susceptible to market fluctuations and refinancing challenges, particularly in stressed sectors like office real estate.
*   Potential for impairments or defaults could impact investment performance and, consequently, whole life dividend performance.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Audit the risk management framework and stress testing methodologies applied to the CML portfolio, with a specific focus on upcoming maturities and exposures to vulnerable property types (e.g., office).
*   Assess the adequacy of reserves and capital allocation for potential CML losses and the effectiveness of proactive loan restructuring strategies.

### Persistent Inflationary Pressures on Life and Health Products
**Context**: "Social inflation," where claims costs rise faster than general economic inflation, is identified as a latent risk for the life and health insurance industry. While life insurance benefits are often specified in nominal terms, future expenses for life insurers are vulnerable to inflation, which can negatively impact profitability, new business acquisition, and lapse rates. Inflation also steadily decreases the purchasing power of fixed life insurance death benefits over time. Permanent life insurance products, with features like cash value and dividends, may offer better built-in inflation hedges than standard term life policies.

**Relevance to Northwestern Mutual**:
*   Impacts the long-term value proposition of fixed-benefit life insurance products for clients and the profitability of the company due to rising operational and claims expenses.
*   Could influence client demand for different product types (e.g., permanent vs. term) and necessitate adjustments to product design and pricing strategies.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review actuarial assumptions and models for pricing and reserving, ensuring they adequately account for social inflation and its impact on future claims and expenses across life, disability income, and long-term care products.
*   Assess product development processes for incorporating inflation-hedging features and communicating the impact of inflation to clients.
