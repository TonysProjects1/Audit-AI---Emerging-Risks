## Past Day

Here is a news-brief style summary of recent events affecting the Insurance & Financial Services sector, strictly within the date range of November 20-21, 2025.

### Regulatory Enforcement: Sales Practices Misconduct at Major Bank
**Context**: On November 20, 2025, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced enforcement actions, including a Personal Cease-and-Desist Order against Claudia Russ Anderson, a former Community Bank Group Risk Officer of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. This action was taken in connection with the bank's "longstanding sales practices misconduct." This highlights continued regulatory focus on ethical conduct and oversight within large financial institutions.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review the company's sales practices and conduct risk frameworks, particularly within wealth management and annuity product distribution, to ensure robust controls are in place to prevent and detect misconduct.
*   Assess the effectiveness of management's oversight of sales incentives, training programs, and disciplinary processes to ensure alignment with regulatory expectations and policyholder protection principles.

### Financial Stability: Elevated Leverage in Life Insurers Noted by Federal Reserve
**Context**: During the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's Financial Stability Conference, held on November 20-21, 2025, opening remarks on November 20, 2025, specifically noted that while the broader financial system appears stable, "leverage is elevated in some parts of the financial system—including among hedge funds and life insurers." This direct observation from a key financial regulator signals a potential area of vulnerability within the life insurance sector.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the company's asset-liability management strategies and investment portfolio for concentrations in highly leveraged assets or exposures that could be disproportionately impacted by market volatility.
*   Assess the adequacy of capital and liquidity stress testing scenarios to account for potential shocks related to elevated leverage across the industry, ensuring continued solvency and policyholder protection.

## Past Week

Here is a news-brief style summary of recent high-impact risk events affecting the Insurance & Financial Services sector from November 14, 2025, to November 21, 2025:

### Cyber Breach - Third-Party TPA Affecting Insurance Sector
**Context**: Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America was impacted by a data breach in October 2025, with the incident being reported on November 14, 2025. This breach, stemming from a compromise of a third-party Cloud CRM platform, affected nearly 1.5 million records, including sensitive personal data.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review third-party administrator (TPA) contracts and service level agreements (SLAs) to ensure robust cybersecurity clauses and incident response requirements.
*   Test the effectiveness of vendor risk management programs, focusing on due diligence, ongoing monitoring, and incident response capabilities for critical third-party service providers.

### Regulatory Enforcement - FINRA Sales Practice and AML Program Failures
**Context**: FINRA issued several disciplinary actions in November 2025, highlighting failures in compliance and supervision within wealth management. John N. Girgis was barred from association with any FINRA member in all capacities for refusing to appear for on-the-record testimony concerning outside business activities (OBAs) and trading activity. Separately, Maximiliano Ramirez received a deferred fine and suspension for engaging in an OBA without prior firm disclosure and continuing the activity against firm directives. Additionally, Canaccord is reportedly close to settling U.S. compliance issues, including FINRA penalties, for failing to implement a reasonably designed Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the adequacy and effectiveness of policies and procedures related to outside business activities and private securities transactions for all registered representatives.
*   Enhance testing of the AML program's effectiveness, particularly in identifying and reporting suspicious activities related to high-volume, low-priced trades.
*   Review supervisory controls over registered representatives to ensure compliance with FINRA rules and firm policies, including timely disclosure and approval of OBAs.

### Market Turbulence - Equity Market Decline and AI Bubble Anxiety
**Context**: The equity markets experienced turbulence in the latter half of November, with the S&P 500 down approximately 4% and the NASDAQ down about 6% since the end of October, as observed on November 20, 2025. This market decline is occurring amidst ongoing discussions and "AI Bubble" anxiety, despite some positive corporate earnings reports.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the impact of recent market volatility on the company's investment portfolio valuations and overall risk exposures, particularly for assets under management in wealth management products.
*   Review the effectiveness of asset-liability management (ALM) strategies and liquidity stress testing frameworks in mitigating the impact of sudden market downturns.
*   Evaluate the company's communication strategy with policyholders and wealth management clients regarding market performance and investment risks.

### Cyber-Enabled Fraud - North Korean Remote IT Worker Schemes
**Context**: On November 14, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a series of enforcement actions targeting schemes involving North Korean remote IT workers. These workers fraudulently obtained remote employment with over 136 U.S. victim companies, compromising identities and generating more than $2.2 million in revenue for the North Korean government.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review and strengthen third-party vendor onboarding and ongoing monitoring processes, with a specific focus on verifying the identities and locations of remote workers.
*   Enhance identity verification and access management controls for all remote employees and contractors, particularly those with access to sensitive systems or data.
*   Assess the effectiveness of insider threat programs to detect and prevent fraudulent activities by individuals who may have compromised identities or malicious intent.

## Past Month

Here is a strategic analysis of broad trends and systemic shifts relevant to the Life Insurance & Wealth Management sector over the past month (October 21, 2025, to November 21, 2025), prepared for the Internal Audit Planning Committee & Risk Committee.

### Evolving AI Regulatory Landscape and Bias Risk
**Context**: The regulatory environment for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in insurance is rapidly developing. The NAIC's Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers, adopted in December 2023, continues to be a focal point, with ongoing discussions among NAIC members about potentially developing a more comprehensive AI model law or disclosure standard. Concurrently, states like Colorado are implementing their own AI Acts, and the EU AI Act is nearing full enforcement in 2026, requiring insurers to demonstrate fairness, oversight, and control over their AI systems. A "Responsible AI Report 2025" released in mid-November highlighted the shift from "principle to proof" in compliance, emphasizing the need for robust governance, bias prevention, and explainability. Customer skepticism regarding AI in critical functions like claims and policy pricing further underscores the need for transparency and ethical safeguards.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review AI model governance frameworks, including data provenance, bias testing protocols, and human oversight mechanisms, ensuring alignment with the NAIC Model Bulletin and emerging state-specific requirements (e.g., Colorado AI Act).
*   Assess the effectiveness of controls designed to prevent and detect unfair discrimination or bias in AI-driven underwriting and pricing models, including third-party vendor models.

### Persistent Elevated Mortality and Genetic Information Regulation
**Context**: U.S. life insurers continue to face elevated mortality rates, with death benefits paid remaining approximately 14% above 2019 levels as of October 27, 2025, and a 6.4% increase in the first half of 2025 compared to the prior year. This suggests a potential new baseline for mortality post-pandemic, impacting individual life insurance profitability. Simultaneously, the regulatory landscape around genetic testing is evolving. Oklahoma mandated coverage for certain genetic cancer testing in group health insurance policies effective November 1, 2025, requiring coverage without deductibles or copayments. Furthermore, the Australian Government issued draft legislation in late September (with consultation closing October 12, 2025) to ban the use of adverse genetic test results in life insurance underwriting, aiming to prevent discrimination and encourage life-saving testing.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the adequacy of actuarial assumptions and reserving practices in light of persistent elevated mortality trends, particularly for individual life insurance products.
*   Review underwriting policies and procedures to ensure compliance with new and evolving state laws regarding genetic testing coverage and the prohibition of using adverse genetic information in underwriting, assessing potential impacts on risk selection and pricing.

### Interest Rate Declines and Annuity Product Repositioning
**Context**: The Federal Reserve implemented a 25-basis-point rate cut on October 29, 2025, marking the second such reduction this year. This macroeconomic shift is directly impacting the annuity market, with several carriers already reducing fixed annuity rates that recently topped 6%. Financial experts are signaling the close of a "high-rate window," advising consumers to lock in current rates as future payouts are expected to be lower in a declining interest rate environment. This trend affects the attractiveness and pricing of new annuity products, as well as the investment income generated from existing annuity reserves.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the company's interest rate risk management strategies, including asset-liability management (ALM) and hedging effectiveness, in a declining rate environment, particularly concerning annuity liabilities.
*   Review product development and pricing strategies for annuities to ensure they remain competitive and profitable amidst falling interest rates, and evaluate the adequacy of disclosures to policyholders regarding potential changes in future annuity payouts.

### Legacy System Constraints on Digital Transformation & Resilience
**Context**: A significant systemic challenge for the insurance industry remains the widespread reliance on outdated legacy systems. Reports from early November 2025 indicate that a staggering 74% of insurers still depend on these complex, expensive-to-maintain systems, which consume approximately 70% of IT budgets on maintenance. These legacy systems create substantial barriers to scalability, innovation, and digital transformation, hindering the adoption of new technologies like AI and limiting effective data analytics. This inflexibility also impedes the ability to respond quickly to market demands and integrate new features, putting insurers at a competitive disadvantage and posing challenges for regulatory compliance.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the strategic roadmap and investment prioritization for legacy system modernization initiatives, assessing the associated risks (e.g., data migration, business disruption) and the benefits realization.
*   Review the impact of legacy systems on the company's ability to implement advanced analytics and AI solutions, ensuring that data limitations and system rigidity do not compromise decision-making or regulatory compliance.

### Intensified Cyber Threats and Operational Resilience Mandates
**Context**: The financial services sector continues to be a prime target for increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, including hacktivist disruption, financially motivated cybercrime (e.g., ransomware), and nation-state attacks. Recent reports emphasize that adversaries are leveraging new technologies, including AI, for more convincing phishing attacks and target research. Regulators globally, including in the U.S. (e.g., Federal Reserve, NYDFS), are intensifying their focus on operational resilience, moving beyond mere compliance to requiring demonstrable controls and rapid breach reporting. This shift underscores the interconnectedness of financial systems and the critical need to protect entire financial ecosystems from operational failures and cyber shocks.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the maturity and effectiveness of the company's cybersecurity program, including threat intelligence, incident response, and third-party risk management, against the backdrop of evolving and AI-enhanced cyber threats.
*   Review the company's operational resilience framework, including the identification of important business services, setting impact tolerances, and testing capabilities, to ensure alignment with intensifying regulatory expectations and the ability to withstand and recover from significant disruptions.

## Past Quarter

Here are the key trends and systemic shifts observed in the life insurance and wealth management sector during the past quarter (August 21, 2025, to November 21, 2025), along with their implications for audit.

### Evolving AI Regulatory Landscape and Algorithmic Bias
**Context**: The regulatory environment for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in insurance is rapidly evolving, with a notable shift towards requiring demonstrable proof of fairness, oversight, and control in AI systems. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and various state regulators are actively developing comprehensive frameworks for AI governance. During this quarter, the "Responsible AI Report 2025" emphasized that compliance has moved from principle to proof, particularly as the Colorado AI Act and the EU AI Act approach full enforcement in 2026, setting precedents for ethical AI use. Concerns regarding algorithmic bias in underwriting and claims processing, alongside data privacy implications, remain central to these regulatory discussions.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review AI model governance frameworks, including data input validation, bias detection, fairness testing, and explainability mechanisms for underwriting and claims models.
*   Assess compliance with emerging state-specific AI regulations and NAIC guidelines, ensuring transparent data collection and usage policies to mitigate reputational and regulatory risks.

### Macroeconomic Headwinds: Interest Rate Declines and Annuity Product Performance
**Context**: The U.S. annuity market experienced a mixed outlook over the past quarter, with projections indicating a continued decline in interest rates through 2025. This macroeconomic shift is expected to negatively impact sales growth and profitability for fixed-rate deferred (FRD) annuities, income annuities, and, to a lesser extent, fixed indexed annuities (FIAs), which had previously benefited from a higher interest rate environment. While an aging demographic continues to fuel demand for guaranteed retirement income solutions, the declining rate environment presents ongoing challenges for carriers in offering competitive payout rates.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the adequacy of asset-liability management (ALM) strategies and interest rate risk stress testing for annuity portfolios, particularly for products with guaranteed minimums.
*   Assess product development and pricing strategies for new and existing annuity offerings to ensure profitability and competitiveness in a declining interest rate environment.

### Shifting Mortality Trends and Underwriting Modernization
**Context**: Recent reports, including the World Health Organization's (WHO) "World Health Statistics Report 2025" and a study published in August 2025, highlight a significant decline in global life expectancy post-COVID-19, reversing a decade of health gains and indicating higher-than-expected mortality across various cohorts. Concurrently, the global regulatory landscape is evolving concerning the use of genetic information in underwriting. The Australian Government, for instance, issued draft legislation on September 24, 2025, to ban the use of genetic test results in life insurance underwriting, following similar measures implemented in other jurisdictions. These developments necessitate a critical re-evaluation of actuarial assumptions and underwriting practices.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review actuarial mortality assumptions and reserving methodologies to ensure they adequately reflect the long-term impacts of post-pandemic mortality trends and other emerging health risks.
*   Assess underwriting guidelines and data privacy controls related to genetic information, ensuring compliance with evolving anti-discrimination laws and ethical considerations.

### Digital Transformation and Legacy System Modernization Challenges
**Context**: The financial services industry continues to face substantial hurdles in modernizing its legacy systems. These outdated systems consume a significant portion of IT budgets, often up to 70%, and impede the agility and innovation necessary to respond to dynamic market conditions and evolving regulatory demands. Reports indicate a high failure rate for digital transformation projects, with over 80% failing to deliver on their promises, frequently due to factors such as scope creep, a lack of alignment between IT and business objectives, and an underestimation of project complexity. The continued reliance on these systems creates operational inefficiencies, heightens cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and results in data silos, thereby hindering the effective leverage of advanced analytics and AI.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the governance and oversight of ongoing digital transformation initiatives, focusing on project management, risk mitigation strategies, and alignment with strategic business objectives.
*   Assess the cybersecurity posture and data integrity controls of legacy systems, as well as the integration points with new technologies, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities and ensure data security.

### Evolving DOL Fiduciary Rule and Wealth Management Compliance
**Context**: The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) "Retirement Security Rule," which significantly expands the definition of an "investment advice fiduciary" under ERISA, became effective on September 23, 2024, with a one-year phase-in period for certain conditions of the amended Prohibited Transaction Exemptions (PTEs). This rule impacts financial services firms, including insurance agents and brokers, particularly concerning rollover recommendations and the sale of certain annuity products to retirement investors. During this past quarter, the company would have been operating under the full effect of this expanded fiduciary definition, necessitating a review of sales practices, compensation structures, and client engagement models to ensure compliance.
**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review the company's adherence to the expanded DOL fiduciary definition, particularly for advisors providing rollover recommendations and selling annuity products to retirement investors.
*   Assess the effectiveness of training programs, disclosure practices, and compensation structures to ensure alignment with the impartial conduct standards and other requirements of the new rule and amended PTEs.

## Past Year

Here is a strategic analysis of broad trends and systemic shifts relevant to Life Insurance & Wealth Management over the past year (November 21, 2024, to November 21, 2025), tailored for the Internal Audit Planning Committee & Risk Committee.

### Evolving AI Regulation and Bias in Underwriting
**Context**: The regulatory landscape for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in insurance is rapidly developing. As of March 2025, 24 states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by insurers, which was initially adopted in December 2023. This bulletin emphasizes principles of transparency, accountability, and non-discrimination in AI deployment across the insurance lifecycle, from product development to claims management. Concerns about AI bias in underwriting, where models trained on historical data can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing biases, remain a critical focus for regulators and consumer advocates.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review AI model governance frameworks, including data input validation, bias detection and mitigation strategies, and model testing protocols to ensure compliance with the NAIC Model Bulletin and state-specific adoptions.
*   Assess the transparency and explainability of AI-driven underwriting decisions, particularly for adverse outcomes, to mitigate risks of unfair discrimination and regulatory scrutiny.

### Expanded DOL Fiduciary Rule
**Context**: On April 23, 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued a final rule, the "Retirement Security Rule," which significantly expands the definition of an "investment advice fiduciary" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). This rule, generally effective September 23, 2024, imposes ERISA's fiduciary protections on a broader range of investment advisory relationships, including one-time recommendations to retirement investors and those involving annuity sales. Financial professionals providing advice to retirement investors are now subject to stringent conduct standards, including acknowledging fiduciary status in writing and mitigating conflicts of interest.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate the company's compliance with the expanded DOL Fiduciary Rule, focusing on revised disclosure requirements, documentation for tax-qualified annuity sales, and adherence to impartial conduct standards.
*   Assess the training and oversight of financial professionals, particularly those involved in retirement planning and annuity sales, to ensure understanding and adherence to new fiduciary responsibilities and to mitigate potential ERISA liability.

### Digital Transformation and Heightened Cyber Risk
**Context**: The insurance industry continues to grapple with the dual challenge of modernizing outdated legacy systems and defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. As of early 2025, a significant portion of insurers (74%) still rely on legacy technology for core processes like underwriting and policy administration, hindering digital transformation and the effective integration of advanced technologies like AI. This reliance on aging infrastructure creates vulnerabilities and operational inefficiencies. Concurrently, the financial services sector remains a prime target for cybercriminals, nation-state actors, and hacktivists, with ransomware, phishing, supply chain attacks, and AI-powered attacks posing significant risks. The global cost of cybercrime reached $9.5 trillion in 2024.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Review the progress and effectiveness of legacy system modernization initiatives, including integration strategies, data migration, and the management of associated project risks and costs.
*   Assess the robustness of cybersecurity controls, incident response plans, and third-party vendor risk management programs, particularly in light of evolving threats like AI-powered attacks and supply chain compromises.

### Persistent Mortality Trend Uncertainty & Genetic Testing Restrictions
**Context**: While insured mortality rates have largely stabilized and returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2024, lingering uncertainties regarding long-term mortality trends persist, partly due to chronic health conditions exacerbated during the pandemic. This creates challenges for insurers in evaluating future risks and pricing policies. Simultaneously, there's a growing regulatory movement to restrict the use of genetic testing in life insurance underwriting. On September 11, 2024, the Australian Government announced its intent to legislate a total ban on the use of adverse genetic test results in life insurance underwriting, following concerns that previous moratoriums were insufficient. Similar discussions are ongoing in other jurisdictions, reflecting a global trend towards protecting individuals' privacy and encouraging genetic testing for health management without fear of insurance discrimination.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Evaluate actuarial assumptions and reserving methodologies for life insurance products, ensuring they adequately account for persistent uncertainties in long-term mortality trends and potential shifts in life expectancy.
*   Review underwriting guidelines and data usage policies to ensure compliance with current and anticipated restrictions on genetic testing information, particularly for international operations, and assess the impact on risk assessment and product pricing.

### Interest Rate Volatility and its Impact on Product Portfolios
**Context**: Over the past year, interest rate movements have significantly influenced the life insurance and wealth management sectors. Elevated interest rates in 2024 initially impacted whole life sales, shifting demand towards products with longer premium payment periods. However, these higher rates also boosted investment yields for life insurers, contributing positively to overall profitability through 2025. Annuity sales, particularly fixed-rate annuities, experienced record growth in 2024 due to the attractive interest rate environment. Looking ahead, while interest rates are projected to fall, the pace may be moderate, which could relieve pressure on indexed universal life (IUL) and whole life (WL) sales.

**Implications for Audit**:
*   Assess the effectiveness of asset-liability management (ALM) strategies in navigating interest rate volatility and its impact on investment income, product profitability, and capital requirements.
*   Review the product portfolio mix and pricing strategies for annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products to ensure they remain competitive and adequately reflect current and projected interest rate environments.
